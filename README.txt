Euchre Bidding AI
Micah Smith

Personal C++ project developed as a technical exercise in writing a basic feed-forward neural network and evolutionary training algorithm from scratch.

Components:

- Feed Forward Neural Network for making a bid in the card game Euchre
- Evolutionary training algorithm
- Deterministic hard-coded algorithm for playing out a hand of Euchre after bidding. 
- Console-based playable game of Euchre (can be played locally against other players or against trained AIs)
